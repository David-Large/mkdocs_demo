# Edit in Markdown

## Write the docs.

Keep the whole team on the same page — and empower all of your writers to edit and build new pages.

* Bring your existing MkDocs websites
* Build new documentation sites in less than a minute
* Rich forms and DAM integration
* Rely on Git's version control
* Build, edit, and host from one provider
* Collaborate on your docs with CloudCannon

## Draft, review, and approve new content, together

**Create customized approval workflows so your team can truly collaborate.**

Define your content workflows to reflect exactly what your team needs. With CloudCannon you can draft, review, and test new features on standalone staging sites for approval on any device before publishing to production.

## **Close the loop between your technical and non-technical teams**

Developers and content editors can work simultaneously with the same tools — and even on the same branch — keeping changes separate until they’re ready to publish. Because everyone uses two-way Git syncing, everyone's work is always accessible, with no roadblocks.

* Visual editing
* Developer workflows
* Edge hosting
